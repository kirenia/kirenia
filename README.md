### Hi there 👋 my name is Kirenia (keed-'en-yah), and I'm a beginner at coding.
🔭 I’m currently working on a weather app in the SheCodes Plus workshop, and I've singed up on Codecademy for a few courses to find my footing and see what kind of work I'd like to do as a coder.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python on Replit's 100 Days of Code, and I've returned to college to study astronomy, a lifelong pursuit of mine. I'm inching closer to a degree in the field and very excited for what's to come.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involved space-related topics, such as Stellarium, when the time is right.

👩🏽‍⚕️ My background is in emergency medicine, but I have studied astronomy on-and-off since I was in grade school. It's a lifelong dream of mine to become an astronomer. I was also a helicopter mechanic for some time specializing in hydraulic systems and airframes.

⚡ Fun fact: I was born and raised in Cuba. When I came the US with my mom, I graduated high school and joined the Marines. I was able to see the world and do a lot for others. I hope to bring the same to the table wherever I code.
