### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Kirenia (keed-'en-yah), a coding newbie.

Right now, I'm working on a weather app in the SheCodes Plus workshop, and I've signed up for some Codecademy courses to try and figure out what coding gigs I'm into. I'm learning Python through Replit's 100 Days of Code. I'm not yet ready for collaboration. I warmly welcome advice and guidance from those genuinely interested in offering support.ðŸŒ±
