### Hey there! 👋 I'm Kirenia (keed-'en-yah), a coding newbie.

🔭 Right now, I'm working on a weather app in the SheCodes Plus workshop, and I've signed up for some Codecademy courses to try and figure out what coding gigs I'm into.

🌱 I'm learning Python through Replit's 100 Days of Code.

👯 I'm not yet ready for collaboration. I warmly welcome advice and guidance from those genuinely interested in offering support.

👩🏽‍⚕️ My background is in emergency medicine. I left the field to look after my son, and I've returned to college to pursue my childhood dream of becoming an astronomer. 

📫 Reach me here: https://x.com/kire_jm or kire@asu.edu

😄 Pronouns: she/her/ella

⚡ Fun fact: I used to be a helicopter mechanic in the US Marines specializing in airframes and hydraulic systems.
