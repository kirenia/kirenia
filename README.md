### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Kirenia (keed-'en-yah), and I'm a beginner at coding.
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a weather app in the SheCodes Plus workshop, and I've singed up on Codecademy for a few courses to find my footing and see what kind of work I'd like to do as a coder.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python on Replit's 100 Days of Code, and I've returned to college to study astronomy, a lifelong pursuit of mine. I'm inching closer to a degree in the field and very excited for what's to come.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that involved space-related topics, such as Stellarium, when the time is right.

âš¡ Fun fact: I was born and raised in Cuba. When I came the US with my mom, I graduated high school and joined the Marines. I was able to see the world and do a lot for others. I hope to bring the same to the table wherever I code.
