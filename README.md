### Hi there 👋 my name is Kirenia (keed-'en-yah), and I'm a beginner at coding.
🔭 Presently, I am building a weather app in the SheCodes Plus workshop, and I've singed up on Codecademy for a few courses to find my footing and see what kind of work I'd like to do as a coder.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python on Replit's 100 Days of Code, and I've returned to college to study astronomy, a lifelong pursuit of mine. I'm inching closer to a degree in the field and very excited for what's to come.

👯 I’m not ready to collaborate, but I am always open to advice and guidance from those genuinely willing to give it.

👩🏽‍⚕️ My background is in emergency medicine, but I have studied astronomy on-and-off since I was in grade school. It's a lifelong dream of mine to become an astronomer.

⚡ Fun fact: I served as helicopter mechanic in the US Marines specializing in airframes and hydraulic systems.
